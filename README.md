## Running examples

To run defenses, go to a defense folder.
To run attacks, go to an attack folder.

### Run FRONT

FRONT takes in a dataset folder, output a defended dataset into "defenses/results/" folder 
```
python3 main.py ../../data/tor/
```
This generates a dataset into results/ folder using FRONT defense.

```
python3 mp_main.py ../results/glued_trace/ -format ".merge"
```
This adds front noise to l-traces defended by Glue

### Run Glue
```
python3 run.py ../../data/tor2-5-1/ -n 4000 -b 1 -m 2 -noise True -mode fix
```
n: number of l-traces; m: l; b: base rate; noise: add noise or not; 
mode: fix -> all traces are m length; random -> length is randomly chosen from (2, m)

Generate 4000 noisy 2-traces with base rate 1   


## Run kFP or CUMUL or DF attack
Go to an attack folder

To evaluate FRONT, 
First extract features
```
python3 extract.py ../../defense/results/xxx/
```
Then 
```
python3 new_main.py(or main.py) ./results/test.npy 
```
This will generate results of a 10 cross validation result. 

To evaluate Glue,
Use mp-extract.py to extract features, it will generate features for the first page and the other pages seperately (since they need to be evaluated using two WF models).
Then
```
python3 evaluate.py -m a-saved-model.pkl -o leaf.npy(needed for kFP)/training_data.npy(needed for cumul) -p ./results/test.npy
```

random-evaluate.py is used under split with decision scenario. used together with random_attack.py.

## Run kNN
```
./run_attack.sh data_folder log_dir
```

## Run kNN on glue
cd after-split-attack, mp-kNN contains customized kNN for split finding case; randomkNN2 contains customized kNN for split decision + finding case

For example, cd mp-kNN, run
```
./run_attack_head.sh train_folder test_folder log_dir
```
This evaluate the first split webpages.
```
./run_attack_other.sh train_folder test_folder log_dir
```
This evaluate the other split webpages.

## Split decision 
Go to "attacks/decision" 
```
python3 run_attack.py -train trainset -test testset -num l
```
This corresponds to split decision process.       
It will generate a ".npy" file telling the prediction of l of all l-traces in testset.       
"-num" indicates this testset contains traces of length l.       
trainset contains l-traces of different l; testset only contains traces of the same l.         

## Split finding
Go to "attack/xgboost"
```
python3 run_attack.py -train trainset -test testset -mode decision/finding -kdir ../decision/results/testset.npy
```
This corresponds to split finding process.    
It will generate a splitresult.txt file telling where the splits are in a trace.     
"-mode" whether you run split decision or not.     
Note if mode is decision, then you should give the predicition of "l" using "-kdir "

## Versioning

For most of the codes, they use Python3 as default. Except for kNN codes.
